## Local development 👨🏻‍💻

To see it in action in your local development environment, you need a set of
services which Wordpress relies on. You start off by creating the docker image:

```
docker build -t custom-wordpress:5.7-php7.3-apache .
```

Then start all the services and run the setup:

```
make up
make setup
```

You can now go to https://localhost/wp-login.php > Plugins > Activate the
**Perfecty Push** plugin.

## Available commands 👾

```
# start the service containers
make up

# stop de service containers
make down

# remote console
make console

## Testing ✅

This project relies on automated tests as in the [Wordpress Core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/writing-phpunit-tests/) guidelines.

Run all the test suites:

```
make test
```

Run a single test:

```
make console
cd wp-contents/plugins/perfecty-push/
phpunit --filter test_schedule_broadcast_async
```

## Troubleshooting

```
make console
chown -R www-data wp-content
```

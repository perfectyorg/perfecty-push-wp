== Installation ==

## Perfecty Push installation

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I am using a third-party Push Notifications provider, can I migrate my users to my server? =

Absolutely, Perfecty Push can override the previous service worker from your user's browser. Once they visit your site, the worker is automatically replaced and you can start sending Push Notifications directly. For that you need to first remove your provider's JS SDK, and then enable the `Remove conflicting workers` option in Perfecty Push. Go to Perfecty Push > Settings > Public Widget.

After v1.0.7 Perfecty Push uses the `/perfecty/push` scope (you can also customize it), so it's friendly with any PWA/AMP plugin that uses the root scope (e.g. Super PWA plugin). However, if you use the `Remove conflicting workers` option, it will deregister any existing worker, so be careful with this option.

= Why do I need the `gmp` extension? =

Sending push notifications involves encryption and `gmp` (GNU Multiple Precision) brings the best performance for such operations.

The `gmp` extension is optional in PHP >= 7.3. In PHP 7.2 you can't generate the VAPID keys without it, however you can still generate them with `openssl`. In any case, it's recommended to use `gmp` for better performance.

= How do I install the `gmp` extension? =

It depends on the operating system, but in theory you install it as a regular PHP extension. More information: [Install the gmp extension](https://github.com/rwngallego/perfecty-push-wp/wiki/Troubleshooting#install-the-gmp-extension)

= Is this working in production? =

This plugin has been deployed in a real site with more than 800.000 monthly visits and around 3.000 Push Notifications subscribers (~90.000 notifications/month), however we recommend you to test it before deploying it to a production environment.

= How do I report a bug? =
